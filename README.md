# Ward Superintendent
I have long been frustrated over how difficult it can be to figure out which Chicago ward I'm standing in. 

Ward Superintendent, named after aldermanic supervisors within Streets and Sanitation who can prioritize service requests, uses browser geolocation and the Socrata API to the [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/) to identify the Ward you are likely standing within.

We also use your location to pull the following common service needs:
* Street Sweeping Schedule
* Public schools
* Recent 311 Requests: Rodent complaints, Graffiti, more coming soon

## I know my Ward. What would I need this for?
The city makes it fairly easy to find ward information based on a street address. However, I find that sometimes I'm away from home and would like to report something to the local Alderman. Some requests don't fit within 3-1-1's parameters. Or I've already reported something to 3-1-1 and it hasn't been resolved. That's where Ward Superintendent steps in.

## Down the Road
Later, I would like to gather feedback from users on how Aldermen have responded to their concerns, eventually developing a metric for how responsive an Alderman has been.
