# Ward Superintendent
I have long been frustrated over how difficult it can be to figure out which Chicago ward I'm standing in. 

Ward Superintendent, named after aldermanic supervisors within Streets and Sanitation who can prioritize service requests, uses browser geolocation and the Socrata API to the [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/) to identify the Ward you are likely standing within.

## I know my Ward. What would I need this for?
The city makes it fairly easy to find ward information based on a street address. However, I find that sometimes I'm away from home and would like to report something to the local Alderman. Some requests don't fit within 3-1-1's parameters. Or I've already reported something to 3-1-1 and it hasn't been resolved. That's where Ward Superintendent steps in.

## Coming Soon
Soon, Ward Superintendent will get you talking to the ward office in seconds. When Ward Superintendent geolocates your device, the ward lookup will also return the Alderman's name and office phone number and best contact email address for service requests.

## Down the Road
Later, I would like to gather feedback from users on how Aldermen have responded to their concerns, eventually developing a metric for how responsive an Alderman has been.
